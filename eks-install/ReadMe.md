**which directory I run terraform commands?**
  You should run Terraform commands in the root directory where your main Terraform configuration files exist, typically where your main.tf, variables.tf, and other .tf files or your environment-specific folders (e.g., environments/dev, environments/prod) are located.
  
  For example, if you have a structure:
  
  <img width="432" height="158" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a9bfa4f-f951-45e7-9f26-46812c4e1a79" />
  
  You would run Terraform commands like terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply inside the project_root/ directory or inside a specific environment subdirectory such as project_root/environments/dev/ if you manage environment-specific config there.

  Make sure your terminal is pointed (cd) to the directory containing the Terraform root config that you want to apply. This directory must have the main Terraform files that call any modules.

  If your environment has remote backend configured, the init will connect and sync the state accordingly.

**The typical Terraform commands to create AWS resources based on your Terraform code:**
1. Initialize Terraform

   Download and install the necessary AWS provider plugins and initialize the working directory:

   **$terraform init**

2. Validate Terraform Configuration

   Optional step to check the syntax and validity of your Terraform files:

   **$terraform validate**

3. Generate and Review Execution Plan

   Preview the actions Terraform will take to create/update infrastructure:

   **$terraform plan**

4. Apply the Terraform Plan

   Create or update AWS resources as defined in your Terraform code. Confirm when prompted or use -auto-approve for no prompt:

   **$terraform apply**
   
   #or to auto-approve
   
   **$terraform apply -auto-approve**

6. Verify Created Resources

   You can verify resource creation in AWS Console or use CLI commands like:

   **$aws ec2 describe-vpcs**
   **$aws ec2 describe-subnets**

7. Destroy Resources (if needed)

   Clean up and remove all created infrastructure:

   **$terraform destroy**

Running this sequence will safely provision your AWS VPC, subnets, gateways, route tables, security groups, and VPN gateways as per your Terraform configurations.
